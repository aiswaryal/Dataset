# Primary Task - Answer the following questions:

# Which single field in dataset.csv best describes the SalePrice field?

Ans : OverallQual

# Why did you choose this field? Please thoroughly explain your reasoning.

Ans : 

     After analyzing the data I have concluded that QverallQual best describes the SalePrice data because it has highest correlation score amongst other attributes.
     Also beacuse OverallQual covers what other attributes has to offers. 
    For example when a person is buying a house most of the time the features that a person is looking for in a house like electricity supply, location, accessibility to main     road, etc. are commmon and these features are covered under the attribute QverallQual. 
     When calculating SalePrice we have to take into consideration a number of attributes and the field OverallQual serves the purpose by providing us a general idea about the house will be.
